// model* are different questions, and listing them flat asks both at once.
//
// So builds are collapsed under the model they build. The group key is the slug
// with its engine prefix and its trailing build modifiers stripped; everything
// that survives is the model itself, which means a distinct finetune (AEON
// Ultimate, Heretic) correctly keeps a row of its own.

// Trailing slug tokens that describe *how* a model was built, never which model
// it is: quantization formats, per-tensor precision overrides, and
// speculative-decoding drafters. `bf16head` is the last of those — a checkpoint
// that leaves the output projection dense while the body stays quantized is a
// build of the model, not a different model.
