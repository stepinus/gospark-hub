# sah — Spark AI Hub launcher

One CLI command per OpenAI-compatible client. `sah opencode` launches
OpenCode wired to whatever LLM the Spark AI Hub is currently serving.
Switch models in the Hub UI; clients keep working without reconfiguration.

## Install (on any device that can open the Hub)

```sh
curl <the URL in your browser's address bar>/sah/install.sh | sh -s -- --key sah-xxxxxxxx
```

Use the Hub's own address exactly as you reach it — `http://spark.local:9000`
on the LAN, or the https hostname if it is behind a Cloudflare Tunnel. The
Hub's **Connect an app to your model** panel prints this whole line ready to
paste, filled in with the address you are browsing from and your own key.

The key is your own — the panel includes it, or find it on your **Account**
page. A Hub running with authentication turned off does not need one.

The Hub serves this script with its own reachable addresses baked in — the one
you fetched it from, plus its mDNS name, Tailscale name and LAN IP — and `sah`
falls back through them, so a changed DHCP lease never breaks the client.

Every run, `sah` checks its own copy against the one the Hub serves and, if
they differ, replaces itself and carries on with the updated version, so it
stays in step with the Hub without re-running the installer. Set
`SAH_NO_UPDATE=1` to skip the check.

Override the Hub URL:

```sh
curl http://<hub>:9000/sah/install.sh | sh -s -- --hub http://other-host:9000
```

## Usage

```sh
sah                     # pick a client from a menu and launch it
sah info                # show Hub URL and current model
sah models              # list every running model (sah <client> uses the biggest)
sah integrations        # list integrations, support mode, and lifecycle commands
sah env                 # print OPENAI_BASE_URL / OPENAI_API_KEY exports
sah env --anthropic     # same but ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL / ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN

sah chatgpt --install         # wire the ChatGPT desktop app to the Hub
sah opencode-desktop --install  # wire the OpenCode desktop app to the Hub
sah claude-desktop --install  # wire Claude Desktop to the Hub

sah <client> --install  # configure the plain client to use the Hub, without launching
sah <client> --status   # show the client's Spark AI Hub wiring status
sah <client> --restore  # put the client's original settings back
sah <client> -- <args>  # pass args to the underlying client

sah set-hub http://1.2.3.4:9000   # change the Hub URL
sah set-key sah-xxxxxxxx          # save your Hub API key on this device
```

## Authentication

Every request sah makes to the Hub carries your API key. It is read from
`$SAH_API_KEY` if set, otherwise from `~/.config/sah/key`, which the installer
writes (mode 600) when you pass `--key`. If the Hub rejects it, sah says so and
tells you to run `sah set-key`.

## How it works

The Hub exposes an OpenAI-compatible proxy at `http://<hub>:9000/v1` (and an
Anthropic-shaped one at the root) in front of every LLM it is running. Several
can run at once. `sah <client>` lists every running model in the client's own
model picker and makes the biggest the default, so you switch models inside the
client rather than by re-running sah; launch or stop a model in the Hub and the
next `sah <client>` picks the change up. A request naming a model that is
running goes to it, and any other `model` value goes to the biggest one.

`sah <client>` wires the client to the Hub and execs it. Clients configured
purely through environment variables or an inline config flag (`claude`,
`opencode`, `codex`, `copilot`, `pool`, `kimi`, `muse`, `dsh`) leave the plain
client's own settings untouched. Clients that can only be configured through
their config file (`hermes`, `openclaw`, `omp`, `cline`, `droid`, `pi`, `qwen`)
have that file rewritten — the original is backed up on the first write, and
`sah <client> --restore` puts it back byte for byte. `sah integrations` shows
which is which under Mode.

## Integration set

The integrations mirror Ollama's launcher registry
([`cmd/launch/`](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/cmd/launch)) — same
names, same aliases, same display order, and the same per-client wiring — so a
client that works with `ollama launch <x>` works with `sah <x>`.

One of theirs is deliberately absent. `vscode` reaches models only through
Copilot Chat's built-in `ollama` vendor, which speaks the Ollama native API
(`/api/tags`, `/api/chat`) and cannot be pointed at an OpenAI-compatible
endpoint. Every integration here talks to the Spark AI Hub and nothing else;
none of them needs an Ollama server running. For the same reason `cline` is
wired through Cline's built-in `openai-compatible` provider rather than the
`ollama` one Ollama's launcher writes.

Where sah has to differ from Ollama it is because the environment differs, not
by preference, and each case is commented in the source:

- **`claude-desktop`** needs a loopback TCP forwarder. Claude Desktop's 3p mode
  requires HTTPS or `127.0.0.1`; Ollama always satisfies that because its
  server *is* localhost, while the Hub is across the LAN over plain http.
- **`muse`** gets a literal IPv4 base URL when the Hub is reached by an mDNS
  `.local` name, because Muse's HTTP client does not resolve those. Tunnel and
  Tailscale hostnames are passed through untouched.
- **`muse`** is also launched with `--reasoning-effort medium`: its default of
  `high` is rejected by the Hub's SGLang backend, and Muse silently retry-loops
  on that error rather than reporting it.
- **`hermes`** config is merged as text rather than with a YAML parser, because
  sah is stdlib-only Python.

Two integrations cannot be launched by sah at all, because they are desktop
apps with no CLI entry point: `chatgpt` and `claude-desktop` are
`--install` / `--status` / `--restore` only, and are macOS/Windows only.

`codex` writes a self-contained `~/.codex/sah.config.toml` and launches with
`--profile sah`, so the root `config.toml` is never read or written. That is
also why it cannot collide with `sah chatgpt`, which does write the root table
because the desktop app reads its model from there. `codex` 0.134.0 or newer is
required for profile config files.
